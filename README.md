## Introduction

I learned that Sepolia is one of the Ethereum testnets used for testing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) before deploying them on the Ethereum mainnet. Also, I learned that testnets like Sepolia provide a cost-effective, and risk-free environment for developers to experiment and validate their applications.

## Setting Up MetaMask for Sepolia Testnet

### Install MetaMask

1. I installed the MetaMask extension from the [official website](https://metamask.io/) on my browser.

### Create a New Wallet

3. In this menu, selected "Show test networks."

### Switch to Sepolia Testnet

1. Selected "Sepolia" test network from the list of available networks.

### Get Sepolia Test Ether

1. Visited the [Sepolia GCP Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) and requested some test ETH by entering my MetaMask wallet address.

## Completing My First Transaction

After setting up my MetaMask wallet and obtaining Sepolia test Ether, I completed my first transaction. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. Ensure you are connected to the Sepolia Testnet in MetaMask.
2. Enter your MetaMask wallet address in the provided field on the faucet page.
3. Complete any CAPTCHA or verification steps as required.
4. Click on the button to request test Ether.
5. Wait for the transaction to be processed.
